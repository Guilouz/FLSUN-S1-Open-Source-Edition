<br /><br />

This Open Source version uses the microSD port of the motherboard to boot on a new OS. Which means that the original OS is not modified. Itâ€™s a kind of dual boot, a simple removal of the microSD card allows to boot on the original OS.

This new OS is based on Debian 12 Bookworm and is ready to use.

**What's included:**

  -	Moonraker (latest build without modification)<br />
  -	Klipper (latest build with modifications for S1 support<b>*</b>)<br />
  -	KlipperScreen (latest build with modifications for S1 support)<br />
  -	Mainsail (latest build without modification)<br />
  -	Moonraker Timelapse<br />
  -	MJPG-Streamer (same as stock) or ÂµStreamer (lightweight and very quick server)<br />
  -	Preconfigured Web interfaces<br />
  -	Improved configuration files with interactive macros<br />
  -	Hostname based on MAC address<br />
  -	Automatic resizing of available space on microSD card<br />

_<b>*</b> All AI features have been removed as they do not work as expected. Only Power Loss Recovery, FLSUN Input Shaper and XY Dimension Calibration features have been kept._

<br />

## PREREQUISITES

-	microSD card with small capacity (e.g. 128MB or 256MB) to flash motherboard firmware

<br />

## MICROSD PREPARATION TO FLASH MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE

Motherboard firmware need to be updated to support latest Klipper version.

- Insert the microSD card with small capacity into your computer.

- Format it in FAT32 and an allocation size of 4096.

- Download the Klipper firmware: [Robin_nano35.bin for Open Source Edition](https://github.com/Guilouz/FLSUN-Open-Source-Edition/raw/main/Motherboard%20Firmwares/Open%20Source%20Edition/Robin_nano35.bin)

- Copy `Robin_nano35.bin` file to the root of the microSD card, then you can remove it from your computer.

<br />

## FLASH MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE

- Make sure the printer is turned off.

-	Use the H2.0 hex wrench in the accessory box to remove the screws from the top cover of the printer.

- Insert microSD card into the microSD port on the motherboard:

    <img width="900" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b02b7a9-1088-4c56-a962-48b4a3e488a9">

- Turn on the printer and wait a few seconds, the flash will be done automatically.

- Installation only takes a few seconds, to verify that the firmware has been successfully installed, the file on the microSD card must have been renamed to `ROBIN_NANO35.BIN.CUR`.

- Turn off the printer, you can remove the microSD card and screw the printer top cover back on.

**Note:** If you want to go back to stock OS you need to reflash motherboad with this firmware: [Robin_nano35.bin for Stock OS](https://github.com/Guilouz/FLSUN-Open-Source-Edition/raw/main/Motherboard%20Firmwares/Stock/Robin_nano35.bin)

<br />

## INSERTING MICROSD CARD FOR FLSUN OS

- Make sure the printer is turned off.

-	Use the H2.0 hex wrench in the accessory box to remove the screws from the top cover of the printer.

-	Use the H2.0 hex wrench in the accessory box to remove the screws above the screen:
