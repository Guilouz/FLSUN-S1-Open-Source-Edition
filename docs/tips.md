### Lock Screen
<hr>

You can lock the screen with password. Note this is not a secure system, it's saved as plain text in **KlipperScreen** configuration file, but it's intended to deter children or people present when printing.

- Open **`KlipperScreen.conf`** file:

	- On **Mainsail** Web Interface go to **`MACHINE`** tab on the left side.
	- On **Fluidd** Web Interface go to **`Configuration`** icon on the left side.

- Remove the **`#`** symbol before **`lock_password `** setting and define pasword you want (by default: **flsun**):

	``` title="KlipperScreen.conf" hl_lines="4"
	[main]
	# Set the password to use when locking the screen, this is not a secure system, it's saved as plain text,
	# but it's intended to deter children or people present when printing.
	#lock_password: flsun
	```

- Once done, click on **`SAVE & RESTART`** button at the top right to save the file.

- You can now lock the screen on **Shutdown Panel** when is needed:

### Power Button
<hr>

You can control the short press of the power button (right of the screen).

	- On **Mainsail** Web Interface go to **`MACHINE`** tab on the left side.
	- On **Fluidd** Web Interface go to **`Configuration`** icon on the left side.

- And edit this macro by replacing the Gcode command with whatever you want to run when you short press the power button:

	``` title="macros.cfg" hl_lines="4"
	[gcode_macro _PWR_KEY]
	description: Short press for power button
	gcode:
	  M117 Short Press done!
	```

- Once done, click on **`SAVE & RESTART`** button at the top right to save the file.
