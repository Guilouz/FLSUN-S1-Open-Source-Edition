	<img width="600" src="../assets/images/bootlogo.jpg">


	If not, your image was not correctly written to your microSD card, try another microSD card or retry: <a href="../prepare-microsd-card-for-flsun-os">:material-micro-sd: Prepare microSD Card for FLSUN OS</a>  

- Once you are on the **KlipperScreen** interface, click on **`Configurations`** ‚Üí **`Network`** and connect to your WiFi network.<br />Your local IP address should be displayed in the top right corner.

- Wait for **Moonraker** and **Klipper** to connect, if not click **`Retry`** button.<br />The LEDs on the left side of the screen should light up white as soon as the connection is established.

- Then, restart the printer (this is important for the proper functioning of the OS).

- Next, take a look to <a href="../klipper-configurations-files">:material-file-restore: Klipper Configurations Files</a> section.

- Enjoy :smiley:
