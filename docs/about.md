**FLSUN-OS** is an Open Source version for **FLSUN S1** that uses the microSD port of the core board to boot on a new OS.

This means that the Stock OS is not modified. It‚Äôs a kind of dual boot, it's easy to go back to Stock OS.

This new OS is based on :simple-debian: ***Debian 12 Bookworm*** and is ready to use. It's more stable and has better performance.<br />
It has the advantage of having a support until June 2028 unlike Debian 10 (Stock OS) which expired in June 2024.
