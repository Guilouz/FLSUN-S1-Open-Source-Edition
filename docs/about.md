**FLSUN-OS** is an Open Source version for **FLSUN S1** and **FLSUN S1 Pro** that uses the microSD port of the core board to boot on a new OS.

This means that the Stock OS is not modified. It‚Äôs a kind of dual boot, it's easy to go back to Stock OS but it can also be installed on eMMC memory.

This new OS is based on :simple-debian: ***Debian 13 Trixie*** and is ready to use. It's more stable and has better performance.<br />
It has the advantage of having a support until June 2030 unlike Debian 10 (Stock OS) which expired in June 2024.

Benchmark comparison between **STOCK OS** (Board flsun) and **Open Source Edition OS** based on Debian 12 (FLSUN-OS): <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/22823940?baseline=22823878">:material-web: Geekbench.com</a>
